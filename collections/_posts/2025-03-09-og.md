The meeting brought together researchers and analysts from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP),
the Department of Finance (DOF), the House of Representatives' Congressional Policy and
Budget Research Department (CPBRD), and various universities in Visayas and Mindanao, . .
Several attendees expressed enthusiasm for integrating the OG-PHL model into their institutionsâ€™
ongoing policy formulation and research. These include BSP, DOF, and CPBRD, which aim to
explore how the model can provide more robust, evidence-based simulations for fiscal and
macroeconomic policy. Academic institutions such as the University of the Philippines Visayas
(UPV), Xavier University-Ateneo de Cagayan (XU), Ateneo de Davao University (ADDU), and
the Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU) also signaled plans to utilize the model for
instructional and research purposes.
Participants also explored the possibility of enhancing the Philippine OG model further,
especially its demographic module. Some users have engaged with the UN DESA team to share
simulation results and request technical feedback.
The meeting included: Cymon Lubangco (BSP), Louie Sabal (XU), Gay Defiesta (UPV),
Adrian Castro and Gabriel Salar (DOF), Rutcher Lacaza (CPBRD), Christian Pasion
(ADDU), Krizia Garcia (USC), and Philip Arnold Tuano (ADMU), who facilitated the
discussion.
