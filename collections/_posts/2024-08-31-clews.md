A workshop on Climate, Land, Energy, and Water Systems (CLEWs) was held in Swapkomund, 
Namibia from 27-30 August to provide a refresher course of the country tailored model and 
conduct policy scenario analysis. The main objective of the workshop was to guide participants
in the development of scenarios to inform the National Development Plan (NDP6). Thematic 
groups were established to work on three key policy issues: 1) Agricultural modernization and food 
security; 2) Biomass power plant as an alternative to electricity imports and 3) water security. 
The implementation of the CLEWs methodology 
and institutional arrangements is being carried 
out as part of the UNPDF project, in 
collaboration with the Namibian government, 
the United Nations Department of Economic and 
Social Affairs (UN DESA), the Resident 
Coordinator Office (RCO) Namibia, the Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO Namibia), the 
World Food Programme (WFP Namibia), the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP 
Namibia), the University of Namibia (UNAM), 
and the United Nations Economic Commission 
for Africa (UN ECA).
