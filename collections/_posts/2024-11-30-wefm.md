On 26-28 November 2024, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), in collaboration with the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), organized a “National Workshop on Advanced Training on Macro-Fiscal Modelling and Forecasting for Jordan”. This was the first national workshop providing in-depth training on UN DESA’s World Economic Forecasting Model (WEFM), under the umbrella of UN DESA’s modelling capacity development project. 
About 15 participants from Jordan’s Ministry of Finance and Department of Statistics attended the workshop. This three-day intensive training provided a comprehensive overview of Jordan's country model, including the structure, data requirements, and applications in policy simulation. Moreover, a user-friendly web-based simulation interface was introduced to simplify the process of policy scenario analyses. Participants received hands-on guidance on constructing a country model, calibrating parameters, developing a baseline scenario, designing and running simulation, and interpreting modelling results. The workshop marked a significant step in empowering Jordanian officials to enhance forecasts of economic growth and fiscal variables, as well as to design government expenditure strategies that align with the country’s development priorities while ensuring debt sustainability.
