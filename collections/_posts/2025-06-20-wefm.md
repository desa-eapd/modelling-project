On 16-19 June 2025, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), in collaboration with the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), organized a “National Workshop on Advanced Training on Macro-Fiscal Modelling and Forecasting for Tunisia”. After a similar workshop in Jordan in 2024, this was the second national workshop providing in-depth training on UN DESA’s World Economic Forecasting Model (WEFM), under the umbrella of UN DESA’s modelling capacity development project. Over 20 participants from Tunisia’s Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, Ministry of Economy and Planning, and the Tunisian Institute of competitiveness and quantitatives studies (ITCEQ) attended the workshop. The three-day intensive training provided a comprehensive overview of Tunisia’s country model, including the structure, data requirements, and applications in policy simulation. Moreover, a user-friendly web-based simulation interface was introduced to simplify the process of policy scenario analyses. Participants received hands-on guidance on constructing a country model, calibrating parameters, developing a baseline scenario, designing and running scenario studies, and interpreting modelling results. The workshop empowered Tunisian officials to carry out forecasts of economic growth and fiscal variables, as well as to design government expenditure strategies that align with the country’s development priorities while ensuring debt sustainability.
