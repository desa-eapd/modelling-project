From 14 to 17 April 2025, the first national training workshop in Lusaka was held under the UN project “Rebuilding Better and Greener from the COVID-19 Pandemic.” The workshop introduced participants to a Zambia-specific version of the Climate, Land, Energy and Water Systems (CLEWs) model, aimed at supporting data-driven and integrated national recovery strategies.
Hosted at the Urban Hotel, the workshop brought together experts from key ministries—Energy, Finance, Green Economy, Mines—as well as ZESCO, UNZA, CEEEZ, and other institutions. Through interactive sessions and hands-on exercises, participants explored real-world scenarios using the CLEWs model, gaining practical skills to support sustainable decision-making.
Watch the video below to hear participants share their experiences and insights on how CLEWs can help shape Zambia’s development planning.
