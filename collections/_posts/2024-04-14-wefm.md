In April 2024, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) formalized an agreement to support selected Arab states in macroeconomic forecasting and policy simulations. The aim is to enhance decision-making around financing social expenditures and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using the World Economic Forecasting Model (WEFM).
Following this agreement, ESCWA has made significant strides in customizing the model to meet the specific needs of Jordan and Tunisia, and started developing a user-friendly interface and comprehensive user manual for the WEFM.
In Jordan, progress has been bolstered by official government support. The Ministry of Finance has expressed strong interest to conduct training on the WEFM tailored to Jordan in late 2024, with planning for the event set to begin soon.
