From 11–15 November 2024, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), in collaboration with the KTH Royal Institute of Technology and national stakeholders, hosted the Introductory Workshop on the Climate, Land, Energy and Water systems (CLEWs) in Vientiane, Lao PDR. The event marked the beginning of a broader effort to strengthen integrated, data-driven planning in the country through systems-based modelling approaches.
This foundational workshop formed part of UN DESA’s ongoing programme to build national capacity for quantitative analysis in support of sustainable development planning. The CLEWs framework is a powerful integrated assessment tool that helps identify synergies and trade-offs across food, energy, water, and climate sectors. By using country-specific data and a participatory model design, the CLEWs approach supports coherent and evidence-informed policy decisions.
The training provided an introduction to the CLEWs methodology, including conceptual sessions and practical exercises using a demonstration model. Participants learned how to build and operate the CLEWs model, explore interlinkages among key sectors, and design policy scenarios aligned with national development priorities. The workshop brought together officials from government ministries, academic institutions, and research organizations, who gained hands-on experience in model structuring, data preparation, and scenario analysis. The overarching goal was to support the integration of CLEWs tools into national planning processes.
This introductory event laid the groundwork for continued collaboration to expand and apply the CLEWs model in Lao PDR. By investing in national capacity and fostering cross-sectoral dialogue, the initiative aims to enhance the evidence base for climate resilience, sustainable land use, and equitable energy and water access.
